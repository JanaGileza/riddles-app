# Future Changes to Consider

## UI

1. Upon user feedback, determine if focus modal should be changed to a simple UI visual feedback instead.
2. Turn off ability to type in answer box after 3 attempts potentially

## Tech Debt

1. Generalize and get rid of "riddle" name spaces in each component under RiddleForms folder to allow more universal component naming
2. Generalize any specific attributes in current "riddle-x" components to allow more usability in other areas of the project
